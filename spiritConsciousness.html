      <p> Creation, Creator, Godhead, God, Dao, BenYuan and Zhenru all refer to the same Spirit, The Creation Spirit, and HE is the ONLY source of all universes. All physical universes were created by The Creation-Spirit. The Creation-Spirit has infinitely high wisdom, consciousness and power, and infinite in scope. The Creation-Spirit follows HIS routine to create and rest. At the creation phase, HE creates universes continuously, until reaches a rest phase. When The Spirit rests, there will be a time, except The Creation-Spirit nothing exists. </p>
      <p> When The Spirit has a thought and wants to manifest, a “spark” is created within The Spirit. And then the Spark will "explode"  to begin the creation of a universe. At the beginning, a newly created universe contains mostly hydrogen gas and various individualizations of self differentiated from the source - The Creation-Spirit. </p>
<p> Physical objects are fields oscillated with different frequencies and energy concentrations. This is part of the reason that why "physical existences" are called physical illusions. Except for the physical part, every physical object has a field with many distinct layers ( wan wu jie you ling! ) containing information, like the simple structure of matter, the string frequency, its makeup and make up history … etc. All physical matters, we see, have an information-energy equivalence in the field space. That means that all physical object has a mirror in the innumerable layered field space.  </p>
<p>  Consciousness is information and energy matrix. It resides mostly in the field space of an entity. Consciousness is divided into 12 levels or dimensions. ( The consciousness of The Creation-Spirit is not in these 12 levels. It is the most high and infinite in scope. )  </p>

<p><h3> 12 Consciousness Levels: </h3> </p>
<p> 1. )   mineral level or simple "existence" level, even a hydrogen atom has consciousness.  </p>
<p> 2. )   living organism level or plant kingdom. DNA configuration begins to manifest from this level. DNA is a kind of energy pattern.  </p>
<p> 3. )   animal kingdom level.  </p>
<p> 4. )   enlightened human being level.  </p>
<p> 5. )   fifth-dimensional light body, celestial level.  </p>
<p> 6. )   celestial beings known as Angels and Archangels level.  </p>
<p> 7. )   7-dimension celestial level.  </p>
<p> 8. )   8-dimension celestial level.  </p>
<p> 9. )  </p>
<p> 10. )  </p>
<p> 11. )  </p>
<p> 12.)  </p>
<p>  "Life" or consciousness in our university evolves in two directions. One direction is from level 1. ) to level 12. ). 
This process is called evolution: spirit consciousness evolves back into Oneness with God, The Creator. In this 
evolution direction, at the first 4 levels, spirits evolve with physical entity. After level 4, humans can evolve 
independently without the need a physical body ( or together with a physical body ). On the other hand, high-level spirits, if 
they have the will, can drop their frequencies to incarnate in low-realm entities, following the direction from level 
12. ) to level 1. ). This process is called devolution. Here, evolution and devolution refer to the development of 
spirit consciousness. </p>
<p> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>
<p> At consciousness level <a href="./moreonspirit.html">3</a>, the spirit evolves together with a physical entity. </p>
<p> Human consciousness is continuously evolving. More and more people are awakening!  </p>
