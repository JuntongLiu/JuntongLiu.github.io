      <h3> 2.)  Universes:  </h3>  
      <p> GOD created all universes. Our universe is one of them. Our universe is not limitless. It has a boundary. Our universe will not expand forever.  When it reaches a certain size, the universe will start to contract, and then expand again. Our universe is not stand-still, it is moving. Spirit is life, the mind is builder, results are physical. Energies, vibrations and frequencies, fields. <br>

      <h3> 3.) Maldek: </h3>
      <p>  Maldek was a planet orbiting our sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. A very long time ago, a nuclear war erupted on the planet. One big nuclear weapon penetrated into an underground nuclear weapon storage facility. One big explosion followed by a huge explosion blew up the planet into pieces. The asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is the result of the destruction of the planet Maldek. <br>

      <h3> 4.) Mars: </h3>
      <p> Many people have already known that there was a nuclear war on Mars which destroyed the surface of Mars a long time ago. The
re is no need to utter it here anymore. However, one thing that needs to be mentioned is that the war was originally planned to 
be a limited-scale nuclear strike. But, once started, it escalated into a full-scale nuclear war quickly. The outcome would have
been much worse if all launched weapons had reached their targets. <br>
